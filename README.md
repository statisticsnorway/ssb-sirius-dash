### Installing the pre-release version

This version contains new features and improvements that are heading to the stable release eventually, but is still subject to changes.

```console

### Installing the development version

This is the currently in-development version. Be aware that this is a very unstable version and is subject to rapid breaking changes.
- Primarily intended for testing of in-development features.

First add this to your pyproject.toml:

> name = "testpypi"<br>
> url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"<br>
> default = false<br>

poetry add --source testpypi ssb-sirius-dash --allow-prereleases
```
